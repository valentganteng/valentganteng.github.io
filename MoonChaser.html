        <h2>The La Luna's Manor</h2>
        <p>The year is 1669, a huge building is erected near a lake in Austria.
            A merchant of all things that's sellable is the owner of this manor. Accompanied with his bedridden wife and a teenage son, his only fruition after 30 years of marriage.
            The manor itself is surrounded by a garden of woods on it's west  and huge lake in another. Julien La Luna,the only heir of La Luna is 18 at the time. As a boy of his age, always filled with a sense of wonders.
            When his mother is still well, he always ask about everything that amazed him, and when his father comeback from his trip to ask about what he saw in another side of the world. For Julien, his world is a small place.
            He seldom goes outside because of his frail body. But Julien knew that the world is vast, filled with wonders but wander he cannot.
        </p>

        <h2>Lakeview Chamber</h2>
        <p>For Julien, he always spend his time in his own room. His room is enormous, filled with many kinds of ornament that his father used to bring from his trips.
            Julien's room is also filled with a no end of books, he likes to read sciences books and tries to self-taught himself because he doesn't go to school nor have a tutor.
            His room is also installed with a huge window, the one that is often seen in cathedral. At night, Julien likes to position himself near the edge of the window looking at the outside world that himself cannot taste of.
            From the window that see the lake, he always wonder his mind all night long about one thing in particular, the reflection of an blue-ish white ball. The lake that reflect the moon splendidly.
        </p>

        <h2>Moon River</h2>
        <p>"O' lake, that often shows me the world. O' lake, that let itself become a home to all kinds of creature. Please let me feel this one thing, one thing that you shows every night but perish when the yellow from the sun come!"
            Julien and the moon, the moon that gives Julien a fire of living, the moon that hug him when he's asleep at night, the moon that illuminate when the candles is blown. Julien always wonder, what it would feels like to be on the moon.
            Will there be a cure for his mother and himself, will there be a place that worth adventuring for, or better yet a place where he can rest for the final time. When the sounds of cricket amplify, the moon positions itself on top of the forest.
            That usually will be the time for Julien finally take a rest for the day.
        </p>

        <h2>Lilith and Her Black Wings</h2>
        <p>A person just manifest itself in the other side of his window. The manor is a towering place, with no way to climb from the lake side. Julien is scared, but is now petrified when the shine from the moon illuminate from what is a shadow in form of a person into a crystal image of
            girl. The girl has red as her eye color, really long darkened hair, skin that is really pale that you wonder if she is really sick or not. The girl now knocks on his window. Julien still petrified didn't know what to do from this surprised meeting.
            After a few minutes of knocking, Julien realized that this girl from the another side of window doesn't have any ill intent. He opens the window for the girl to come through. The girl looks hurt, it seems there's a blood flowing from a wound that looks like it came from a sharp object.
            Julien while scared, is asking the girl some questions. "Who are you? How did you get in front of my window? Are you okay? you look really hurt."The girl answer with a heavy breath that comes between each answer. "My name is Lilith. Hah. Please help me patches up this wound! Hah. I'll answer any of your questions later."
            Julien now hastily looking at his medical cabinet, a cloth that can be used to cover Lilith's wounds. "Thank you Julien." Lilith said with a faint voice. Not long after that, she looks unconscious. Julien now have so more question for this girl, like how did she know his name.
        </p>

        <h2>Morning Farewell</h2>
        <p>The sun rise later in the winter. Julien is now awake all night, anxious about this girl that somehow just get into his house. When the sun light penetrate his window, Lilith makes a displeasant voices. Now julien try to wake Lilith up from her slumber.
            Waking up, Lilith reflectively moves further from the window area. Julien surprised from her sudden movement, is asking Lilith about last night.<br>
            <br>"Thank you Julien, you treat me well"<br>
            "wait, how did you know my name?"<br>
            "everyone that lives near the lake know your name"<br>
            "but how? i never step a foot outside this manor"<br>
            "your mother tells us a lot about you"<br>
            "what? mom?"<br>
            "Yes, Selene La Luna"<br>
            Now even more confused, Julien wonder. His mother has a fragile body, she rarely goes outside of her own room, so how did she met lilith.<br>
            "anyway, how did you get in front of my window last night?"<br>
            "with my wings ofcourse."<br>
            "your wings? what wing?"<br>
            "This wings." On her back now appeared a set of wing, a sets of feather with the same color as her hair.
        </p>

        <h2>Night Reunion</h2>
        <p>"I'm sorry Julien, but now i have to go. I really don't want to be beamed by the sun". Still petrified from what he just seen, Julien agreeing Lilith departure.
            His night without a single rest is now catching to him, he knock himself cold, sleeping till the sun is now on the top of the manor. Awake, Julien now get himself into the dining room still feeling shocked, believing the recent events as a weird dream.
            In the dining room, there sat his father, Lucyan La Luna helping himself with some food that already been prepared by the manor cook.<br>
            <br>"Julien, you just woke up did you?"<br>
            "Yes father, i think i am a bit sick right now. So i just been sleeping in my bed all night."<br>
            "Poor Julien, i actually have a gift for you. maybe it can help mediate your sickness just a little bit."<br>
            "Thank you father, but may i ask what gift did you bring me this time?"<br>
            "You say you always want your own telescope right? i just met with someone who want to trade his old telescope with some goods."
            <br>"Thank you so much father, it feels like my illness is fading away right now."Julien says with highly enthusiastic voice. <br><br>
            Julien is eager to try his new telescope, but the day is still not yet mature. He know that he must wait till night come to use his telescope.
            If he try to use it at the sun, he's afraid that the bright light will fry his eyes off. When the night finally come, he sets up his telescope facing the now opened window.
            Like a kid that just got their first gift, Julien put his eyes on the lenses. Fascinated by the view that the moon gives, he try to move his telescope to another location. Expecting a good view from the other side of the moon.
            Now when the eyes touches the observations lens, the only thing that he can see is a red oblong shape object with black dot in the middle. <br>
            "Hey Julien, what's this thing that you got?" heared a girly voice that come straight from the other side of the telescope. Surprised to knew it was Lilith, Julien jump back because of the shock.<br>
            "Dear God, Lilith can you please not scare me in the middle of the night!". Lilith only answer with a playful giggle.
            <br>"so why did you come here again? need another stitches?"
            <br>"i came because i want to see you!"<br>
            "why would you even want to see me? i don't think i have anything that can interest you."<br>
            "You actually have what i want."<br>
            "Your brain"<br>
            "what? My brain?I'm not giving you my brain, that's for sure."<br>
            "ehh?but Julien brain looks really delicious."<br>
            "please Lilith, you know i just can't let you eat my brain. I only have one!"<br>
            "What? I'm not going to eat your brain! I just want to taste it."<br>
            "now you making me more confused."<br>
            "tell me about everything, anything! just like your mom used to do under the moonlight, uttering us a story that help us sleep."<br>
            "what?But okay I'll do it i guess if it means it get you out of my telescope." Julien now aggreeing reluctanly.
            <br>"I guess I'll tell you about the moon and the sun and the planet." Julien now starting his explanation about the object of the sky, about how the old believe is wrong telling that the earth is the center of the solar system and that the planet is orbing the sun in an elliptical orbit instead of a circle
        </p>

        <h2>Moon Chaser</h2>
        <p>Lilith is now excited to hear more about another stories from Julien. But Julien doesn't want to tell another story, he prefers to indulge in his telescope then talking with Lilith.<br>
            "So this telescope thing. It's used to see the moon and stars right?"<br>
            "Yeah"<br>
            "Is it fun to just seeing and not touching or feeling it?"<br>
            "Lilith, you know that it's impossible to reach for the moon right?"<br>
            "Eh? is it really that hard to reach for the moon?"<br>
            "The moon is actually thousands leagues away from here, you have to make a really tall ladder to reach it."<br>
            "It's okay Julien! We will chase the moon together! With your brain and my strength we will reach it in no time. We will be the first moon chaser!"<br>
            "Moon chaser eh? hahaha." The night is now filled with their voices, coating the sounds of insects and wolf howl.
        </p>

        <h2>Selene La Luna, the goddess of moon</h2>
        <p>Both in bed, only layered with blanket and clothes on the cold floor. Julien is curious about the relationship of Lilith and his mom.<br>
        "Hey Lilith, how did you get to know my mother?"<br>
        "It's been so long since i met your mother, i believe i first met her when i was still a kid wandering around the lake looking for a place to sleep."<br>
        "So when i was a kid i hate the darkness that is night, so i always find a place with a bit of light to assure me."<br>
        "and when i found a beam of faint white light coming from the edge of the lake, that's when i first met your mother"<br>
        "Being around her is really nice, it's warm and soothing. She always tell me and another creature of the forest a story. She tell us a story about you Julien, about how you always want to grab the moon as a gift for your mother, about how you want to have a tour around the world."
        "your mother is a goddess Julien, a moon goddess. It's about time for you to know about the real her."<br>
        "my mother is the moon goddess?"<br>
        "yes Julien, do you know why she was bedridden all of the sudden? It's because of the moon light is fading Julien. The sky is now covered by the ashes of war. The stampede that caused by the sea of horses, burning houses that gives smoke!"<br>
        "Dear God, I can't believe that all of this is real."<br>
        "But It's okay Julien, your mother will be well soon. Rumour is the war is coming to an end."<br>
        "Thank God, I only wish my mother wellbeing."<br>
        "You are a good son for her Julien."
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Fall of The Moon Heir</h2>
        <p>The La Luna's Manor is busier now than ever. Lucyan is now delaying all of his business trips. The son of the La Luna couple, Julien, is now bedridden.
            He suddenly get really sick. The manor is filled with physicians and priests that is hired by Lucyan. Julien fever is really high and can hardly speak or move.
            The same symptoms that showed from his mother sickness. Lucyan is now doing all his best to cure both of them. He can't fathom about the loss of his two life love.
            When night come, Lilith came from the window just as usual, hoping a good night chat with his now lover. But the aura around Julien room is now different then the night before.
            Lilith rush into Julien bed. Seeing her dearest sick makes her want to cry. His skin is now as pale as her. Lilith put his mouth beside his ear.<br>
            "Julien please wake up, it's Lilith. I came to see you again."<br>
            "Julien please, please"<br>
            "Please Julien wake up!"now with tears running down on her faces, voices cracking from the cry.<br>
            "Lilith, you as chatty as ever" Julien woken up, gazing his eyes on Lilith, with very poor voice that Lilith can barely hear.
            "Oh My God Julien, you're still alive" now crying even harder<br>
            "Lilith please don't cry. I hate to see a cheerfull girl like you crying."<br>
            "Julien, please make a contract a with me. I'm a vampire, i can make you a vampire also. You can live forever, you dont have to be sick anymore. Please Julien, please just say yes"<br>
            "Lilith, i know that you are a vampire from the first night we  met. But still, i can't accept your offer, i want to live my life as a son of the La Luna. I already live good enough life"<br>
            "No Julien, you cannot live like this. The power of the moon is not for a men, it was meant for a girl. Your mother has given most of it's power to you so you can live long enough. Please just accept my offer"<br>
            "Is that so? please tell my mother i love her and please give her back her power that she gives to me. I am thankful and happy to be the son of the Selene."<br>
            "But what about me?"<br>
            "What about us? the dream we made to chase the moon together?" Lilith is crying so hard that it can wake the whole manor up.<br>
            "I'm sorry Lilith, i guess the moon is not within my reach in this life. But you Lilith, you can still reach it. Please chase it for us"<br>
            "No! I want to go to the moon with you, please Julien. I love the side of you that never give up even with your circumstance. Please for now, show me those side that i love again. Please!"
            "Lilith, i love you too. But i don't think i can go on anymore. Please take my necklace and bury it under the moon sand when you reach it."<br>
            "And one more thing, please hug me. Just like you, I also scared of the dark."<br>
            Now they both hug each other. Lilith felt how fragile Julien has become. She cry. With his last effort, Julien whisper to Lilith.<br>
            "I guess i been chasing the wrong light this time, i should have chasen a live with you than the moon.Lilith you are brighter than the moon, you are warmer than the moon, you felt more real than the moon. I love you."
            Lilith without considering Julien disagremeent to be turn into a vampire, chose to bite his neck in hope he became a vampire so Julien can live longer.
            But the effort is futile, a dead person is a dead vampire.
            </p>

        <h2>We Reach The Moon</h2>
        <p>Lilith crying now can be heard all over the forest. Lilith took the necklace out of Julien neck and put it in her pocket. Selene now suddenly become healthy
            The power that has been given to his son, now finally come back to her. The goddess of moon finally shed her first tears, Lilith now determined to reach the moon. Confront Selene for the last time.
            Selene remember Lilith as the one that she used to tell a story to. They hug crying for Julien loss. Lilith tells Julien mother about their wishes to reach the moon and how happy Julien is to become the son
            of the goddess of the moon.The next night, the burial is done in the lake beside the manor. Julien carcass is drown in the middle of the lake, where the moon shine the brightest all night.
            <br><br>
            The year is now 1969, it has been 300 years after Julien La Luna death. Everyting has changed since the death of Julien. The manor that they used to chat in, is now a museum. The telescope that they used to connect with is now
            really powerful so it can see the sun without damaging the eyes. Science has been improved rapidly, giving the possibility of a moon landing. The only that hasn't change is Lilith. She still look the same like when Julien first met
            her in his window. Lilith is now an astronaut for the Appolo 11 along with Neil Armstrong dan Buzz Aldrin. Finally wearing the necklace that used to tangle Julien neck is now on her. <br><br>
            "Julien we finally reach the moon, the world has changed so much after the last time i see you. Now i can finally see you again in the reflection of my helmet. Julien i always feel that we took this 300 years journey together.
            I always want to be your eyes, your leg, and your hand. Now i will bury you into the earth of the moon. This time i will do the talking for you Julien. The moon really is beautiful. You can see the earth cleary from here without using a telescope. The white sands is not something you can see on earth.
            There's nothing on the moon here, only some crates. This place is really deserted and lonely just like you describe it. But i guess that is the part where you are wrong. I dont feel lonely up here, Julien, because you will always be here by myside."
