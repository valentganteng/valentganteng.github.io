        <h2>Planet Parade</h2>
        <p>A planet parade, a common event for the solar system. Multiple celestial bodies aligning with each other into a single line.
            Planet parade is appealing to watch. Especially for this coming planet parade, 7 celestial body; all planets in the solar system is aligned into a single file.
        </p>

        <h2>An astrophysicist.</h2>
        <p>Seventeen years has been passed since i live on this mother earth. I don't know what the material that compose my body;my father's semen and mother's ovary, used to be when they are still a space dust.
            If i have to guess, I think the hydrogen that construct myself used to be a mid sized stars: a red giant. A so-so kind of stars, the one that is not big enough to become a supernove or eternalized as a black hole.
            I work in the aerospace agency from my country. I got the offer when i was just sixteen;2023. At that time, i gladly accept their offer, I never really like school, I do think is not a place for me. 
            I spend my days working on a coordinate system for the universe, seeking any new celestial bodies that has not been categorized.
            </p>

        <h2>Interest</h2>
        <p>A planet parade. Of course i know of it, it's a common things that happen on this solar system. Nothing big. It always come out in the news, sure it's kinda cool, many cosmos enthusiast setting up a camp to see the lining planets.
            This time is no different, i saw it on the newspaper this morning. "7 Planets will be lining up into a single file on 25th January!". 4 or 5 planets is kinda common for this type of thing, but 7? I think it's cool. My work here is kinda dull at the moment,
            primarly because the observation telescope is recently been near a star, so the image reception is not so great at the moment. Usually I just spend my time looking at past photos, spotting any missed object. With this boring work, I try to look into this coming planet parade,
            calculating the time when will this thing happens again.

        <h2>The Worst Part About Gravity</h2>
        <p>I found it! 1 December in the same years. Well I pretty much done the interesting part, I wonder what I should do next tho. Gravity plays a big part in this kinda of thing, Of course the sun is the main contributor, but jupiter also play a small role, small but big relative to the earth influences.
            So here's what i wanna do next, making a system of two body problems with the sun and jupiter as the two big body. I kinda want to know what will happen to earth, that's in the middle of both. Nothing, i found any anomalies that will happen to earth. So i just spend the rest of my shift dozing off.
            <br><br>
            Tonight, I can't sleep my ass off. Maybe it's because I already slept at work. I spend the night, visualizing the planet parade. 7 planets lining up together. I realized, that the planet behind the jupiter also lined perfectly. that means the gravitational pull is larger on jupiter's side.
            So i do my calculation again, this time one of the body is not only jupiter, but I'll also add another planet gravitational pull. What comes after the calculation is shocking, I do my calculation multiple times so I am sure I am right. The earth, this very place that we step our foot on, is going to be crushed.
        </p>

        <h2>Book of Revelation</h2>
        <p><blockquote>"There occurs a great earthquake where "the sun becomes black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon like blood"" (6:12)</blockquote></p>
        <p>In the book of revelation, it is told that when the sixth seal is broken, there will be a great earthquake that occur.
        I think this will be the first time, that the God is finally correct about astronomy. At 25th of January, the earth will ripped itself apart. I can't believe I miss this simple thing when i calculate for the first time.
        The gravitational pull is barely enough to pull the apart. At the first calculation, Jupiter as it self is not enough. But when i add the other planet, the roche limit is overcomed. At first on earth, the sea waves will be stronger. Tsunami will occur all over the place. Permanently submerge any coastal side town.
        All of Netherland will be vanished, Jakarta is no more, Tokyo is now gone. Next, The earth that usually shaped like an egg, now shape like a football, very oblong shape. Thirdly, the moon is ripped into half, everyone on earth can see that what is supposed a full moon night become a half moon instead. And at last, The earth will now ripped itself apart. 
        The gravitational pull of one side is larger than the sun's side.

        <h2>12 Hour Before The World End</h2>
        <p>There's still time before the earth's collapse, 12 hour before the lining of this damned celestial bodies. Shit, I don't know what to do. I decided I am going to keep this to myself, hoping that I'm in the wrong. I don't want to scare the others.
            Fuck, but if it's true. How should I spend my last time on earth? "I text a postcard sent to you, Did it go through?" What the fuck, why did I just fucking sang this song. My mind is going crazy.  I suppose people spend their last time with their loved ones. But for me, I'm not really close with my family and I dont have a lover.
            I guess people will do something that they like before they die, like playing sport or any hobies for the very last time. But my fucking hobby just made me realized that the world is going to end soon. I think I'll be going to the observatorium then, spending my last time in the place that I love most. <br>
            At the observatorium gate, I met with the night guard. He ask me why i would go to observatorium at night, I tell him that the an object that I'm interested in is only observable at night. He let me in into the building. There, I talk to him about what would he do if the world is going to end soon. He replies with laughter at first, then he tells me that he would
            spend his time with his family. I added, "what if I don't have someone that I loved?". "Well I guess yo better looking for someone to love then! love is sure for everyone." he answers with laughter at the end. Alone. I'm thinking what i should do. I guess having  someone to love is nice. There is somegirl that i used to look upon to when i was still in school. My math tutor.
            She's 27 at the time, a very mature person, long brunnete hair, beautiful faces that is decorated with mole and glasses. I always feel comfortable around her. Should I tell her about my feeling? I guess i could. I don't want to die with any regrets. I text her, "hey miss, this is Yuki. sorry to text you at night. but I just reminiscence our time at school. I always have this feeling of comfort when I am with you. I don't want to make it weird. But I just want to tell you about it."
            I think this is good enough, I never confess to a girl before. But whatever, the world is going to end soon. So i click send on my phone and turn off my phone. The observatorium is also connected with a museum, I spend my time walking, reminiscing the time when I was still a kid that just fall in love with cosmos. Then i finally rested at the chair of the big telescope in the observatorium.

        <h2>1 Hour Before The World End</h2>
        <p>I think it's funny that I spend 11 hours of the last of my time sleeping on a telescope. I guess I just dont care anymore. The Earth will be crushed in an hour. My mind become dull, I accept the fate. I don't think I want to pray, I don't really believe in God anyway, and if there is, God want this.
            My body is surprisingly relaxed. I eat an onigiri that i bought from the supermarket. I guess this it. fifty-three minutes left until humanity perish. I like to think I spend my life goodly. The only thing in my mind is the thought of what will normal person do when they know the world is going to end.
